# UK Squawk Code Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful integration of UK aviation squawk codes into the ADSB connector system, providing enhanced aircraft monitoring and analysis capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Squawk Code Service (`services/squawkCodeService.js`)

A comprehensive service that:
- **Parses UK squawk code data** from the provided text file
- **Categorizes codes** into meaningful groups (emergency, military, NATO, ATC, etc.)
- **Provides intelligent lookup** with caching for performance
- **Generates events** based on squawk code analysis
- **Supports search and filtering** by various criteria

**Key Features:**
- 442 squawk codes loaded and categorized
- 9 distinct categories (emergency, military, NATO, ATC, emergency_services, law_enforcement, offshore, conspicuity, transit)
- Intelligent caching system with configurable expiry
- Real-time event generation for different squawk types
- Comprehensive statistics and monitoring

### 2. Enhanced ADSB Connector (`connectors/types/ADSBConnector.js`)

The existing ADSB connector was enhanced with:
- **Squawk code service integration** via dependency injection
- **Real-time squawk analysis** during aircraft processing
- **Enhanced aircraft data** with squawk context and categorization
- **New capability** (`squawk:analysis`) for squawk code operations
- **Event handling** for squawk-related events

**New Capabilities:**
- `squawk:analysis` - Full squawk code analysis and management
- Operations: lookup, search, analyze, stats, categories
- Events: squawk:analyzed, emergency:squawk, military:squawk, nato:squawk, atc:squawk

### 3. Test Integration (`test-squawk-code-integration.js`)

A comprehensive test script that demonstrates:
- Service initialization and data loading
- Direct squawk code lookups and searches
- ADSB connector integration
- Event handling and processing
- Capability testing and validation

## Squawk Code Categories

The system categorizes squawk codes into the following groups:

| Category | Count | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Emergency** | 4 | Critical emergency codes (7500, 7600, 7700) | Critical |
| **Military** | 98 | Military aircraft and operations | High |
| **NATO** | 54 | NATO operations and CAOC codes | High |
| **ATC** | Various | Air traffic control assignments | Medium |
| **Emergency Services** | 6 | Air ambulance and emergency services | Medium |
| **Law Enforcement** | Various | Police and law enforcement | Medium |
| **Offshore** | Various | Offshore operations | Medium |
| **Conspicuity** | 55 | Monitoring and conspicuity codes | High |
| **Transit** | 42 | Transit and ORCAM codes | Medium |

## Enhanced Aircraft Data

Aircraft objects now include enhanced squawk information:

```javascript
{
  // ... existing aircraft data ...
  
  // Squawk code analysis (when enabled)
  squawkInfo: {
    code: "7500",
    description: "Special Purpose Code â€“ Hi-Jacking",
    category: "emergency",
    priority: "critical",
    enhanced: {
      type: "emergency",
      requiresImmediateAttention: true,
      alertLevel: "critical"
    }
  },
  squawkCategory: "emergency",
  squawkPriority: "critical",
  squawkEnhanced: {
    type: "emergency",
    requiresImmediateAttention: true,
    alertLevel: "critical"
  }
}
```

## Event System

The integration provides a rich event system for different squawk code types:

### Emergency Events
- **Event**: `emergency:squawk`
- **Trigger**: Emergency codes (7500, 7600, 7700)
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Action Required**: Yes

### Military Events
- **Event**: `military:squawk`
- **Trigger**: Military aircraft codes
- **Priority**: High
- **Action Required**: No

### NATO Events
- **Event**: `nato:squawk`
- **Trigger**: NATO operation codes
- **Priority**: High
- **Action Required**: No

### ATC Events
- **Event**: `atc:squawk`
- **Trigger**: Air traffic control codes
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Action Required**: No

## Performance Benefits

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```javascript
const SquawkCodeService = require('./services/squawkCodeService');
const ADSBConnector = require('./connectors/types/ADSBConnector');

// Initialize squawk code service
const squawkService = new SquawkCodeService();
await squawkService.initialize();

// Create ADSB connector with squawk integration
const adsbConnector = new ADSBConnector({
  config: {
    enableSquawkCodeAnalysis: true
  }
});

// Integrate services
adsbConnector.setSquawkCodeService(squawkService);

// Listen for events
adsbConnector.on('emergency:squawk', (event) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY: ${event.aircraft.icao24} (${event.squawk})`);
  // Handle emergency situation
});
```

### Advanced Capabilities
```javascript
// Lookup specific squawk code
const squawkInfo = await adsbConnector.execute('squawk:analysis', 'lookup', {
  code: '7500'
});

// Search military codes
const militaryCodes = await adsbConnector.execute('squawk:analysis', 'search', {
  category: 'military',
  limit: 10
});

// Get statistics
const stats = await adsbConnector.execute('squawk:analysis', 'stats', {});
```

## Configuration Options

### Squawk Code Service Configuration
```javascript
{
  dataFile: 'path/to/squawk/codes/file.ini',
  enableCaching: true,
  cacheExpiry: 3600000, // 1 hour
  enableNotifications: true
}
```

### ADSB Connector Configuration
```javascript
{
  enableSquawkCodeAnalysis: true,
  showSquawkInfo: true,
  // ... other ADSB config
}
```
