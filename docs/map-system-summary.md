# Real-Time Map System - Concept Summary

## Overview

The Real-Time Map System represents a significant evolution of the Looking Glass platform, providing a unified spatial interface that enhances both configuration and monitoring capabilities while maintaining the modular connector architecture that makes the system so powerful.

## Core Concept Thinking

### 1. **Map as a Connector**

The fundamental insight is that the map system should be implemented as a **Map Connector** within the existing connector framework. This approach provides several key benefits:

- **Consistency**: Follows the established patterns and interfaces
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with other connectors
- **Extensibility**: Can be enhanced with new capabilities over time
- **Modularity**: Can be instantiated multiple times for different contexts
- **Standardization**: Uses the same event system and capability framework

### 2. **Multi-Functional Interface**

The map serves multiple purposes simultaneously:

#### **Configuration Interface**
- Drag-and-drop camera positioning
- Zone definition and editing
- Detection line placement
- Property management
- Spatial relationship mapping

#### **Real-Time Visualization**
- Live event display
- Analytics visualization
- Status monitoring
- Alert overlays
- Historical data playback

#### **Connector Integration Hub**
- Unified view of all systems
- Cross-connector data fusion
- Context-aware rendering
- Real-time data streaming

### 3. **Context-Aware Design**

The system intelligently adapts its display based on:

- **Connector Capabilities**: Shows only relevant data types
- **Spatial Context**: Displays elements in their proper relationships
- **User Mode**: Switches between edit and view modes
- **Data Availability**: Handles missing or delayed data gracefully

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Spatial Data Model**

The spatial data model is designed to be:

- **Extensible**: Easy to add new element types
- **Performant**: Efficient spatial queries and rendering
- **Persistent**: Export/import capabilities for configuration management

### 2. **Real-Time Data Streaming**

The system uses a streaming architecture that:

- **Subscribes** to data streams from other connectors
- **Filters** data based on spatial and temporal criteria
- **Visualizes** data with appropriate animations and colors
- **Caches** data for performance and offline capability

### 3. **Connector Integration Framework**

Each connector can:

- **Register** its spatial context with the map
- **Stream** real-time data for visualization
- **Query** spatial relationships and analytics
- **Configure** visualization rules and preferences

## Key Capabilities

### 1. **Spatial Configuration (`spatial:config`)**

Provides the foundation for spatial element management:

- **Create**: Add new cameras, zones, detection lines
- **Update**: Modify element properties and positions
- **Delete**: Remove elements from the map
- **Position**: Drag-and-drop positioning with snap-to-grid
- **Resize**: Adjust element dimensions and coverage areas
- **Duplicate**: Copy existing elements for rapid setup

### 2. **Real-Time Visualization (`visualization:realtime`)**

Enables live data display and interaction:

- **Subscribe**: Connect to data streams from other connectors
- **Filter**: Show/hide specific data types or sources
- **Highlight**: Emphasize important events or violations
- **Animate**: Provide visual feedback for real-time events
- **Alert**: Display warnings and notifications spatially

### 3. **Connector Integration (`integration:connector`)**

Facilitates communication with other system components:

- **Register**: Connect other connectors to the map
- **Configure**: Set up spatial contexts and relationships
- **Query**: Retrieve connector capabilities and data
- **Sync**: Keep spatial data synchronized with connector state

### 4. **Context Management (`context:spatial`)**

Manages spatial relationships and configurations:

- **Store**: Save spatial context data for each connector
- **Retrieve**: Load context data for visualization
- **Link**: Connect map elements to connector resources
